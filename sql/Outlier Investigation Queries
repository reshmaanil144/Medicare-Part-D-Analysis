Note: Provider names have been anonymized to protect individual privacy while demonstrating the analytical methodology for investigating 
statistical outliers. The case study shows how systematic investigation revealed a legitimate mass vaccination operation that was misclassified 
in the database as an individual family practice provider, illustrating the importance of following evidence-based analysis rather than making
assumptions about data anomalies.
